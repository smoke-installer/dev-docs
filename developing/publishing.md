# Publishing To Smoke Installer

1. Send an Email

	Email one of the emails in ``CONTACT`` explaining what your game is like, what operating systems it'll support and what architectures it'll support.

2. Wait

	If you get a reply (you likely will) it'll give you instructions on what to do next but to save you some time so you don't need to open it, the next step will be explained.

3. Send another Email
	You need to prove that you really did make a game (send screenshots some source code) then send the executable[s] named ``arch_os_game`` and by the end of the month your game will be on Smoke Installer
after it updates.
