# Game Engines

For developing games we would recommend using Emerald Rs for 2D games and Amethyst for 3D games, Amethyst can also be used for 2D games. 

### Emerald
Emerald is very simple but is only written and maintained by a single person so it should be used for small simple games.

### Amethyst
Amethyst is very stable and has lots of documentation and examples, it should be used for larger and more complex games. Amethyst can also
be used for 2D games and UI development so there are more things you can do with it.
